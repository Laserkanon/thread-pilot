### Task: Apply Async Best Practices with `ConfigureAwait(false)`

-   **Priority**: Medium
-   **Complexity**: Low
-   **Description**: Throughout the solution, especially in lower-level or library-like code, `await` calls do not use `ConfigureAwait(false)`. While this may not cause issues in the current ASP.NET Core context, it is a widely-accepted best practice to use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in non-UI code to improve performance and prevent potential deadlocks if the code is ever reused in a different synchronization context.
-   **Affected Files**:
    -   `src/Insurance/Insurance.Service/Clients/VehicleServiceClient.cs`
    -   `src/Infrastructure/Hosting/ApiKeyAuthHandler.cs`
    -   `src/Insurance/Insurance.Service/Repositories/InsuranceRepository.cs`
    -   `src/Vehicle/Vehicle.Service/Repositories/VehicleRepository.cs`
-   **Action Points**:
    1.  **Review Solution**: Systematically review all `await` calls in the solution.
    2.  **Apply `ConfigureAwait(false)`**: In general-purpose, library, or infrastructure code (like HTTP clients, repositories, and authentication handlers), append `.ConfigureAwait(false)` to all `await` calls on `Task` objects.
    3.  **Skip Application-Level Code**: It is generally not necessary to use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in application-level code like ASP.NET Core controllers, as they are aware of the HTTP context.
    4.  **Verification**: Perform a full build and run all tests to ensure that the changes have not introduced any regressions. The application's behavior should be identical.
