### Task: Implement Automated Semantic Versioning

-   **Priority**: Medium
-   **Complexity**: Medium
-   **Description**: The current process for versioning NuGet packages relies on developers manually updating the `<Version>` tag in `.csproj` files. This process is manual, error-prone, and can lead to inconsistent versioning. To improve the release workflow, this task is to implement an automated versioning system based on commit history.
-   **Affected Files**:
    -   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
    -   Potentially a new configuration file for the versioning tool (e.g., `GitVersion.yml`).

-   **Action Points**:

    1.  **Introduce Conventional Commits Standard**: Document and adopt the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for all future commit messages. This provides the semantic information needed for automated versioning.
    2.  **Integrate a Versioning Tool**: Add a tool like [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/) to the CI/CD pipeline. This tool will be responsible for calculating the semantic version for each build based on the git history (branches, tags, and commit messages).
    3.  **Update the `publish-packages` Job**: Modify the `publish-packages` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use the version number generated by the versioning tool instead of the hardcoded or manually constructed versions.
        -   The tool should be configured to produce stable `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions for the `main` branch and pre-release versions for feature branches.
    4.  **Remove Manual Versioning**: Once the automated system is in place, the `<Version>` tag in the `.csproj` files for the contract libraries can be set to a default like `0.1.0` and will no longer need to be manually updated by developers. The CI pipeline will always override it.
    5.  **Document the New Process**: Update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `README.md` to explain the new automated versioning workflow to developers, including the importance of using Conventional Commits.

-   **Verification**:
    -   After merging a `fix:` commit to `main`, the pipeline should publish a `PATCH` version bump.
    -   After merging a `feat:` commit to `main`, the pipeline should publish a `MINOR` version bump.
    -   Commits to feature branches should result in new, unique pre-release packages being published.
