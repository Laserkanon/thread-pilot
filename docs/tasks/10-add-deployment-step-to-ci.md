### Task: Add a Placeholder Deployment Step to CI

-   **Priority**: Low
-   **Complexity**: Low
-   **Description**: To complete the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) loop, the pipeline needs a deployment step. This task involves adding a basic, placeholder deployment job to the CI workflow. This job will simulate a deployment to a "staging" environment, demonstrating where a real deployment script would go without requiring actual infrastructure.
-   **Affected Files**:
    -   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

-   **Action Points**:

    1.  **Create a New Deployment Job**: In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, add a new job named `deploy-staging`.
    2.  **Set Job Dependencies**: This job should run only after the `publish-images` job has successfully completed. Use the `needs` keyword to define this dependency.
        ```yaml
        deploy-staging:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          needs: publish-images
          # ...
        ```
    3.  **Use GitHub Environments**: Configure the job to use a GitHub Environment named "staging". This is a best practice for managing deployments, as it allows for environment-specific secrets and protection rules in the future.
        ```yaml
        deploy-staging:
          # ...
          environment:
            name: staging
            url: https://staging.example.com # Placeholder URL
        ```
        You will need to create the "staging" environment in the repository settings under `Settings > Environments`.
    4.  **Implement Placeholder Script**: The job's steps should simulate a deployment. A good placeholder is to simply echo the actions that would be taken. This can include the image tags that would be deployed.
        ```yaml
        steps:
          - name: 'Deploy'
            run: |
              echo "ðŸš€ Deploying to staging environment..."
              echo "Image: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/vehicle-service:${{ github.sha }}"
              echo "Image: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/insurance-service:${{ github.sha }}"
              echo "âœ… Deployment successful"
        ```
    5.  **Add Manual Approval (Optional)**: For a more realistic workflow, configure the "staging" environment in GitHub to require manual approval before the `deploy-staging` job can run. This demonstrates a common control for deploying to sensitive environments.

-   **Verification**:
    -   After merging a change to `main`, the CI pipeline should run.
    -   After the `publish-images` job completes, the `deploy-staging` job should run.
    -   The output of the `deploy-staging` job should show the "Deploying..." echo commands.
    -   In the summary of the GitHub Actions run, you should see a link to the "staging" environment.
