### Task: Create Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Stubs

-   **Priority**: Low
-   **Complexity**: Low
-   **Description**: To enable repeatable, version-controlled deployments to cloud environments, it's essential to define infrastructure as code (IaC). This task involves creating the initial directory structure and stub files for managing infrastructure using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). This prepares the repository for future work on deploying the services to a real environment.
-   **Affected Files**:
    -   New directory: `infrastructure/`
    -   New file: `infrastructure/main.tf`
    -   New file: `infrastructure/variables.tf`
    -   New file: `infrastructure/outputs.tf`

-   **Action Points**:

    1.  **Create `infrastructure` Directory**: Create a new top-level directory named `infrastructure` in the root of the repository. This will house all the IaC definitions.
    2.  **Create `main.tf` Stub**: Create a file named `infrastructure/main.tf`. This is the main entrypoint for Terraform. The stub should contain comments explaining its purpose and placeholders for the provider and resources.
        ```terraform
        # main.tf - Main infrastructure definitions

        # Configure the cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS)
        # provider "azurerm" {
        #   features {}
        # }

        # Define a resource group
        # resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
        #   name     = "threadpilot-services-rg"
        #   location = "West Europe"
        # }

        # Define resources for the services (e.g., App Service, Container Apps, AKS)
        # and the database (e.g., Azure SQL).
        ```
    3.  **Create `variables.tf` Stub**: Create a file named `infrastructure/variables.tf`. This file is used to declare input variables, making the configuration reusable.
        ```terraform
        # variables.tf - Input variables for the Terraform configuration

        # variable "environment" {
        #   description = "The deployment environment (e.g., staging, production)."
        #   type        = string
        #   default     = "staging"
        # }

        # variable "location" {
        #   description = "The Azure region to deploy resources to."
        #   type        = string
        #   default     = "West Europe"
        # }
        ```
    4.  **Create `outputs.tf` Stub**: Create a file named `infrastructure/outputs.tf`. This file is used to declare output values from the infrastructure, such as service URLs or connection strings.
        ```terraform
        # outputs.tf - Output values from the Terraform configuration

        # output "insurance_service_url" {
        #   description = "The public URL of the Insurance Service."
        #   value       = azurerm_container_app.insurance_service.latest_revision_fqdn
        # }
        ```
    5.  **Add a README**: Add a `README.md` file inside the `infrastructure` directory explaining how to use Terraform to deploy the infrastructure (e.g., `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`).

-   **Verification**:
    -   The `infrastructure` directory should be created at the root of the repository.
    -   The directory should contain the stub files: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `README.md`.
    -   The content of the stub files should match the examples, providing a clear starting point for a developer to begin writing the actual infrastructure code.
